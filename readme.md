This purpose of this project  is to register speakers for conference.
There are rules that decide whether a speaker should be registered and what fee the speaker needs to pay.
The part you see here is the business logic + unit tests.

The task you have is to refactor speaker.js to be more readable and easier to maintain. the requirements are:
1. Each variable / method name should be meaningful
1. Reduce "noise" - unnecessary code / comments / spaces
1. Break down big methods into smaller one. Method which are larger than 10 lines are too large.
1. Apply SOLID principles where needed.
1. Apply DRY principle where needed.
1. Make sure all unit tests are passing after your refactoring

Good luck!
